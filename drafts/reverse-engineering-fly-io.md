# Reverse engineering Fly.io: Part 1. Introduction

This series is for nerds.

If words like Firecracker or Wireguard make you excited, you are in the right place. If you are not sure what those are, you are still in the right place. I hope you will leave excited.

As the title suggests, we are going to reverse engineer (parts of) Fly.io. If you didn't know already, Fly.io is an ambitious public cloud provider. A simple search on HackerNews would probably give you a better picture than I can paint here. This series is of course not sponsored by Fly.io in any way, though I wish it was, because they're cool. My contacts are on the index page.

We are going to work only with publicly available information for the simple reason that I do not work and never worked there. Luckily, the amount of information they make public through their blog is incredible. It only takes one curious mind to put the pieces together. 

I am not going to cover every single component, because I simply do not have access to the closed source parts.

Let's begin.
