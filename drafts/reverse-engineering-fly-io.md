# Reverse engineering Fly.io: Part 1. Introduction

This series is for nerds.

As the title suggests, we are going to reverse engineer (parts of) Fly.io. If you didn't know already, Fly.io is an ambitious public cloud provider. A simple search on HackerNews would probably give you a better picture than I can paint here.

We are going to work only with publicly available information for the simple reason that I do not work and never worked there. Luckily, the amount of information they make public through their blog is incredible. It only takes one curious mind to put the pieces together.

This is of course not sponsored by Fly.io in any way, though I wish it was. My contacts are on the index page.

Let's begin.
