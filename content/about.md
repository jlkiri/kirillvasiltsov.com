Hi! My name is Kirill and I am a software engineer at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and an [OSS contributor](https://github.com/jlkiri).

## What I've done

- [typerust](https://github.com/jlkiri/typerust) (author): another Rust playground with a nice interface.
- [ikki](https://github.com/jlkiri/ikki) (author): a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications written in Rust.
- [orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene) (core member): next-generation package manager written in Rust for JavaScript/Node.js projects.
- [daemon](https://github.com/langjam/jam0002/tree/main/daemon) @Lang Jam #2 (author): a domain-specific language that helps to decouple program state from temporal state.
- [statictrace](https://github.com/yumemi-inc/statictrace) (author): a library for semi-automatic static testing. A new approach to code quality assurance that utilizes TypeScript compiler API to be used alongside traditional tests and documentation.

## What I'm working on

- I [write](https://www.kirillvasiltsov.com/writing/) about technology sometimes.
- I am building a toy cloud that might allow beginners to get hands dirty with cloud technology and deployments without paying for services like AWS or GCP.
- I'm getting involved with the Rust ecosystem and I'm looking forward to contribute more to the Rust community.
