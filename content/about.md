Hi! My name is Kirill and I am software engineer at [Progate Inc.](https://progate.com/) and an [OSS contributor](https://github.com/jlkiri).

## What I've done

- [statictrace](https://github.com/yumemi-inc/statictrace): a library for semi-automatic static testing. A new approach to code quality assurance that utilizes TypeScript compiler API to be used alongside traditional tests and documentation.
- [orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene): a next-generation package manager written in Rust for JavaScript/Node.js projects.
- [rust-sdlang](https://github.com/jlkiri/rust-sdlang), [react-easy-flip](https://github.com/jlkiri/react-easy-flip) and more.
- I [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S8GUTcMsgA) at [Svelte Summit](https://sveltesummit.com/) 2020 ([see text version](https://www.kirillvasiltsov.com/writing/unlocking-the-power-of-svelte-actions/)).

## What I'm working on

- As a part of my job, I am building and maintaining an e-commerce platform for a multinational company.
- I'm one of the lead developers on [orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene) and [statictrace](https://github.com/yumemi-inc/statictrace).
- I [write](https://www.kirillvasiltsov.com/writing/) about technology sometimes.
- I'm getting involved with the Rust ecosystem and I'm looking forward to contribute more to the Rust community.
